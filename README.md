# CRM-Project-Delivery

## Introduction  

Northwind Technologies, a growing software development company, faces several challenges. As the company expands, its sales team struggles with managing increasing customer interactions and sales opportunities using outdated methods like spreadsheets and manual record-keeping.  

This lack of an integrated system results in several critical issues:  

- Sales representatives find maintaining accurate and up-to-date customer information difficult without a centralized database, leading to duplicate records and lost opportunities.  
- The absence of a streamlined process for tracking sales opportunities causes delays in the sales cycle, making it hard for the team to prioritize leads and close deals efficiently.  
- Managers lack access to real-time sales data, making it challenging to assess team performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions.  
- Manual tracking of follow-up tasks leads to inconsistent customer engagement, affecting customer satisfaction and retention rates.  
- The sales team uses multiple disconnected tools for communication and scheduling, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for collaboration.  

To address these challenges and support its growth objectives, Northwind Technologies has decided to implement a CRM system tailored to its specific needs. The goal is to provide the sales team with the ability to manage customer relationships, streamline sales processes, and monitor the sales process through advanced reporting and analytics.
